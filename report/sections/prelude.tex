/subsection{Limitations}
For the sake of simplicity and reproducibility, I'll work only considering the free GPU runtime made available through Google Colab. In particular, no considerations will be made in terms of portability of the code or the build process beyond said environment, and although optimization will be done with general techniques, the parameters will inevitably fit to the hardware made available in that environment.
